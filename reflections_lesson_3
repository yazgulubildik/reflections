Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is letting Github clone someones repository to my github account. It also remembers the link to the original repository, also has a
    counter to give the creator the recognition.
    Clone can be used for cloning a reposity in my local computer or from github to my computer. It also creates a remote called "origin"
    automatically.
    branch is not really a copy it is a new child into a family tree. It happens whenever I created it

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
