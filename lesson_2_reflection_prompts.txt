What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the temporary place before I add a commit. It helps to make sure that I am confident with what I want to commit. It also gives the flexibility to choose the files added to the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

If I make a change that I am sure of, but not big enough to put it into a commit, I can put it into a staging area. Then I can take a break or do sth else in my working directory, and if I forget what I did I can compare staging area with WD and see whether they make sense.
I can also compare the staging area with the last commit to see what changes I really made and see whether I made a mistake before committing.
